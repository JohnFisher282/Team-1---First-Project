        <h3> Film Classification </h3>

        <h5> All film classification decisions are based on the British Board of Film Classification's (BBFC) published and regularly updated guidelines. </h5>

        <p> For more detailed information about BBFC rulings, and for information for parents regarding film classifications and their suitability, please visit <a rel="noopener" href="http://www.bbfc.co.uk/" target="_blank" class="externalLink ActivLink" data-treelink="0" data-documentlink="0" data-urllink="1" data-anchorlink="0"><span>www.bbfc.co.uk</span>&nbsp;(opens in a new window)</a>

        <p>The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC, previously the British Board of Film Censors) is a non-governmental organisation founded by the film industry in 1912
            and responsible for the national classification and censorship of films exhibited at cinemas and video works (such as television programmes, trailers, adverts, public
            information/campaigning films, menus, bonus content, etc.) released on physical media within the United Kingdom.</p>

            Universal <br></br> 
            Description: Suitable for all. A U film should be suitable for audiences aged four years and over. <br></br>
            Guidelines: May contain infrequent very mild language. May contain very mild sex references and mild violence, if justified by the context.
            Until 2009, there was also a Uc ("Universal Children") certificate, for videos that were particularly suitable for young children.</p>

            Parental Guidance <br></br> 
            Description: General viewing, but some scenes may be unsuitable for young children. A PG film should not unsettle a child aged around eight or older. <br></br>
            Guidelines: May contain mild language (frequent/aggressive use may result in the work being passed at a higher category) or sex/drug references. May contain moderate
            violence if justified by context (e.g. fantasy). Unaccompanied children of any age may watch, but parents are advised to consider whether the content may upset younger,
            or more sensitive, children. </p>

            12A <br></br>
            Description: Cinema release suitable for those aged 12 and over. No one younger than 12 may see a 12A film in a cinema unless accompanied by an adult. <br></br>
            Guidelines: May contain adolescent themes, discrimination, soft drugs, moderate language, moderate violence, sex references and nudity. Sexual activity may be briefly 
            and discreetly portrayed. Use of strong language may be permitted based on frequency and how they are used, as well as contextual justification. Sexual violence may be 
            implied or briefly indicated. </p>

            15 <br></br>
            Description: Suitable only for 15 years and over. No one younger than 15 may see a 15 film in a cinema. No one younger than 15 may rent or buy a 15 rated video work. <br></br>
            Guidelines: May have fairly mature themes. May contain (frequent) strong language, strong violence, strong sex references, nudity without graphic detail and hard drugs. 
            Sexual activity may be portrayed but without any strong detail. Sexual violence may be shown if discreet and justified by context. Use of very strong language may be permitted 
            based on frequency and how it is used, as well as contextual justification. </p>

        <p> <img src= "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/BBFC_18_2019.svg/1024px-BBFC_18_2019.svg.png" alt="18" width="100px"/> <br></br>
            18 <br></br>
            Description: Suitable only for adults. No one younger than 18 may see an 18 film in a cinema. No one younger than 18 may rent or buy an 18 rated video work. <br></br>
            Guidelines: Films under this category do not have limitation on the foul language that is used. Portrayals of illegal drug misuse are generally allowed, and explicit sex
            references along with detailed sexual activity are also allowed. Scenes of strong real sex may be permitted if justified by the context (Sex works cannot be placed at "18"). 
            Very strong, gory, and/or sadistic violence is usually permitted. Strong sexual violence is permitted unless it is eroticised or excessively graphic, in which a work will require 
            compulsory cuts where possible. </p>
